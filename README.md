In the project directory, you can run the following scripts defined in your `package.json`:

| Script | Command | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `dev` | `npm run dev` | Starts the development server with HMR. Access the app locally (usually at `http://localhost:5173/`). |
| `build` | `npm run build` | Compiles the application for production to the `dist` folder. |
| `lint` | `npm run lint` | Runs ESLint on all `.js` and `.jsx` files to check for code quality and style issues. |
| `preview` | `npm run preview` | Serves the production build locally for a final check before deployment. |

### Running the Development Server

```bash
npm run dev
```

This will run the app in development mode. Open your browser and navigate to the address shown in your console. The page will reload automatically if you make edits.

### Building for Production

```bash
npm run build
```

This command bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance. The build artifacts are placed in the `dist/` directory.
